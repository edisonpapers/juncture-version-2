by the ==Thomas A. Edison Papers=={Q107417971} project team.

## Introduction 

In the exhibit that follows we explore the ways in which Edison, during his lifetime, speculated about the technological future and inspired others to imagine how science and technology would change society.  The centerpiece of this exhibit is the collaboration between Edison and journalist George Parsons Lathrop on a novel of the future in the style of Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward.  It also examines serious and satirical fiction  in which Edison appears as a protaganist and dime novels known as Edisonades.  It concludes by looking at Edison’s own speculations about the future that appeared in newspaper and journal interviews.

## The Wizard of Menlo Park

Almost as soon as Thomas Edison became famous for his invention of the phonograph in early 1878 journalists and writers began to depict him as the “[Inventor of the Age](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/MBSB10561),” capable of producing any invention he set his mind to and as the embodiment of the forces of science and technology that were transforming the modern world. Some of the earliest accounts played humorously with his growing legend. The first was New York Daily Graphic reporter William Croffut’s fantastical [April Fool’s story](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/MBSB10470X) of Edison’s machine for manufacturing food out of “air, water and common earth.”

It was Crouffut who dubbed Edison the =="Wizard of Menlo Park."=={164,1,392,252}

## Punch's Almanack

Later in the year the satirical magazine Punch’s Almanack published a series of humorous drawings depicting Edison’s “[telephonoscope](https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/punch_almanack1879/0006/image),” for transmitting pictures and sound like an early television, and his “[anti-gravitation underclothing](https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/punch_almanack1879/0002/image).”

## Tomorrow's Eve

.ve-media default:https%3A//edison.rutgers.edu/images/sci-fi/sci-fi-tomorrow01.jpeg right width=80%

In 1878 the French writer named Villiers de l’Isle-Adam  was inspired by enormous press attention that was given to Thomas Edison and his newly invented phonograph to write a story he called “L’Andréïde paradoxale d’Edison.”  He subsequently expanded this into a novel entitled  L’Eve future, which was first published in 1886.  In the novel, Edison creates an android—the Eve of the title—that is not only indistinguishable from its human model but even considered a marked improvement upon it.

Although the means by which the fictional Edison employs his phonograph, microphone, electric motors, and even the techniques of mesmerism to create the android has little basis in technological fact, Villiers’s invocation of the famous inventor and his inventions provides a sense of verisimilitude for the fantastic tale that he tells.  In writing his novel, Villiers clearly drew on contemporary newspaper and magazine accounts of the famous inventor to create his fictional Edison, who was already becoming a legendary figure seen as capable of producing any invention and embodying the forces of science and technology that were transforming the modern world.   

## Villers

Villiers describes the transformation of Edison from man to myth In the [preface](https://archive.org/details/lvefuture00villuoft/page/ii/mode/2up) to his book:

> In America and in Europe a legend has sprung up in the popular mind regarding this great citizen of the United States.  He has become the recipient of thousands of nicknames, such as “The Magician of the Century,” “The Sorcerer of Menlo Park,” the “Papa of the Phonograph,” and so forth and so on.  A perfectly natural enthusiasm in his own country and elsewhere has conferred on him a kind of mystique, or something like it, in many minds. Henceforth, doesn’t the personage of this legend—even while the man is still alive who inspired it—belong to the world of literature?  For example, if Doctor Johann Faust had been living in the age of Goethe and had given rise to his symbolic legend at that time, wouldn’t the writing of Faust, even then, have been a perfectly legitimate undertaking? Thus, the Edison of the present work, his character, his dwelling, his language, and his theories, are and ought to be at least somewhat distinct from anything existing in reality. Let it be understood, then, that I interpret a modern legend to the best advantage of Art-metaphysics that I have conceived; and that, in a word, the hero of this book is above all “The Sorcerer of Menlo Park,” and so forth—and not the engineer, Mr. Edison, our contemporary.
[quoted from Robert Martin Adams’s translation, Tomorrow’s Eve, University of Illinois Press, 1982]

## Looking Backward

.ve-media default:https%3A//edison.rutgers.edu/images/sci-fi/scifi-lookingbackward01.jpeg right width=80%

Edward Bellamy’s 1888 novel, [*Looking Backward 2000–1887*](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=dul1.ark:/13960/t66401k8k&view=1up&seq=1), describes a futuristic society in the year 2000 to which the main character, Julian West, travels from the year 1887. He does this via [suspended animation](http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/suspended_animation), the major mode of time travel in in early science fiction writings. In the book, West awakes in an America transformed by a non-violent revolution that abolished private property in favor of state ownership, thus eliminating social classes and social ills such as war, poverty, crime, and labor strife.

*Looking Backward* was a commentary on late 19th century issues and in it Bellamy sought to imagine solutions to real problems.  Following its publication, the book inspired numerous sequels and commentaries, as well as a real political movement through the establishment of Nationalist Clubs intended to realize Bellamy’s vision of the future. Among the book projects inspired by *Looking Backward* was a collaboration between journalist George Parson Lathrop and inventor Thomas Edison.

## Edison and Lathrop

.ve-media default:https%3A//edison.rutgers.edu/images/sci-fi/scifi-lathrop01.jpeg right width=80%

The relationship between George Parsons Lathrop, the journalist/author and Edison, the inventor, began in 1885 when [Lathrop interviewed Edison](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/SM062045) at his New York laboratory.  He reconnected with Edison again in in late 1887 and early 1888 in connection with the promotion of the inventor’s new wax-cylinder phonograph. In June 1888 Lathrop was involved in the effort to create a company to fund an [amusement phonograph](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/D8805ADT) and also [proposed a biography of the inventor](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/D8805ADT) to be published by Samuel Clemens’s publishing company, Charles L. Webster and Co. Neither of these ventures reached fruition but Lathrop continued to propose articles on Edison, finally publishing a new interview with him in the [February 1890 issue of Harper’s New Monthly Magazine](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/SC90012A).

Lathrop’s interest in collaborating with Edison on a novel of the future seems to have been inspired by earlier interviews with the inventor. At the conclusion of his 1885 article and interview, Lathrop described Edison as able to “manipulate as at will and without interruption the mysterious forces and properties of nature. In meeting him I thought of him more as a poet or a musician than as a machinist and electrician. . . .perfecting man’s control over the elements that shape life.”

When Lathrop interviewed Edison in 1890 he presented the inventor with some of his novels.  In response Edison asked if Lathrop wanted “to see my novel?”  Edison then showed him one of his notebooks full of rough sketches and notes. ““These ideas are occurring to me all the time. . . . I just jot them down here whenever they strike me, day or night, and keep them with the hope of getting the leisure to develop them.”  Lathrop noted that this “curious little manuscript volume, in its particular way, answered precisely to the character and use of a story-writer’s note-book. He was right in calling it his ’novel’ for it was full of the keenest imagination.” This notebook likely inspired Lathrop to propose the following June that Edison provide him with similar kinds of notes for their novel.

## Collaborating on Progress

In June 1890, George Parsons Lathrop approached Edison with a [proposal from Samuel Sidney McClure](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/D9004ADA), proprietor of the first U.S. literary syndicate supplying fiction to newspapers.  The proposal was for a “story something after the style of Bellamy’s ‘Looking Backward’” with Edison supplying “[ideas of the possibilities of the future](https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/D9004ADI)” and Lathrop authoring the story. Lathrop and McClure considered Edison’s ideas to be “the backbone of the work.” 

Lathrop’s interest in collaborating with Edison on a novel of the future seems to have been inspired by earlier interviews with the inventor. At the conclusion of his 1885 article and interview, Lathrop described Edison as able to “manipulate as at will and without interruption the mysterious forces and properties of nature. In meeting him I thought of him more as a poet or a musician than as a machinist and electrician. . . .perfecting man’s control over the elements that shape life.”
